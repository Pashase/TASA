This repository contains a full implementation of a TASA (Time-Aware User Embeddings) autoencoder.

TASA is general enough to be utilized for different types of downstream tasks in the realms of advertising, user profiling, or recommendation. These tasks may include click/conversion prediction, user segmentation, lookalike modeling (e.g., retrieving the top-10 most similar users to a given user based on embedding similarity; or leveraging the user embeddings to support other autoencoder approaches for lookalike modeling), recommendation of news, products or ads, among others. This allows for individual teams to carry out their downstream tasks without being burdened with efforts around understanding the data, crafting features (feature engineering), etc.
